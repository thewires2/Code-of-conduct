**CODE OF CONDUCT** 

 

Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document. We Stand for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you're doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, staff, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, we may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us using the reporting procedures defined below Sponsor representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, online interactions in relation to the event, event-related social events, and on event supplied transportation. Reporting Procedures If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to one of the faculty/teaching staff. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous. Codecell Vesit reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, please contact prashant.kannade@ves.ac.in. 

 
 

In case any violation of the code of conduct strict disciplinary action will be taken by the concerned authorities.
